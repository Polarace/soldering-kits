### Badge fw

Lightweight firmware written in c. Uses 2 onboard PWM's and 1 software PWM for dimming LEDs.

I used [XC8](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers/xc8) (v2.46) compiler  with [MPLABX IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide) for development. When compiling, i'd recommend using at least some optimization, although it *should* compile without it.
