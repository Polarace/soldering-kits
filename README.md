# Soldering kit collection
A collection of cheap soldering kits made with simple analog/TTL circuits. 
The aim is to create inexpensive electronic kits that primarily appeal to childern and get them started on their path of electronic engineering. 
The easiest kits are suitable for childern above the age of 6, but anyone wanting to learn the art of soldering can pick one up.
If bear some soldering experience already, look at one of the more difficult kits. More components, more functionality!

All of these kits were made for [MDDM Ãšvaly](https://www.mddmuvaly.cz/) and quality-tested by childern. 

Kits are usually designed for THT parts (ease of soldering), but you may find some SMD or dual versions. 
The circuits use a 3V 2032 baterry due to the small size and cheap price.

Some kits have a `panelize.json` file, which has a configuration for [KiKit](https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) panelization tool. 
Files prefixed with `prod-` contain already panelized versions of the board, although i would recommend panelizing yourself.

[JLCPCB](https://www.jlcpcb.com/) was used for sourcing the PCBs

and [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) for most of the parts.

He looks a little funny, so if you want to make the graphics a little more pretty, go for it!

## Level crossing

**Difficulty:** :star: :star: :black_circle: 

Adaptable level crossing circuit featuring 2 red LEDs. Choose between 2 modes with a solder bridge: 
- Dynamic blinking 
- Activate the LEDs with a touch-sensitive pad

Solderable using SMD or THT parts.

## Electronic dice

**Difficulty:** :star: :star: :star:

This electronic dice isn't as small as a classic one, but it won't fall off of the table during game nights. Shake to generate a random number.
Uses a SW-420 vibration sensor,
