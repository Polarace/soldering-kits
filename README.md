# Soldering kit collection
A collection of cheap soldering kits made with simple analog/TTL circuits. 
The aim is to create inexpensive electronic kits that primarily appeal to childern and get them started on their path of electronic engineering. 
The easiest kits are suitable for childern above the age of 6, but anyone wanting to learn the art of soldering can pick one up.
If bear some soldering experience already, look at one of the more difficult kits. More components, more functionality!

All of these kits were made for [MDDM Ãšvaly](https://www.mddmuvaly.cz/) and quality-tested by childern.

The circuits use a 3V 2032 baterry for the small size and ease of use.

Some kits have a `panelize.json` file, which has a configuration for [KiKit](https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) panelization tool. 
Files prefixed with `prod-` contain already panelized versions of the board.
