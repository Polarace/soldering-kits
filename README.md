# Soldering kit collection
A collection of cheap soldering kits made with simple analog/TTL circuits. 
The aim is to create inexpensive electronic kits that primarily appeal to childern and get them started on their path of electronic engineering. 
The easiest kits are suitable for childern above the age of 6, but anyone wanting to learn the art of soldering can pick one up.
If bear some soldering experience already, look at one of the more difficult kits. More components, more functionality!

All of these kits were made for [MDDM Úvaly](https://www.mddmuvaly.cz/) and quality-tested by childern.

The circuits use a 3V 2032 baterry for the small size and ease of use.

## Kits

### Bat
#### Description:

Black bat-shaped pcb with red glowing eyes. Usable as a Halloween decoration, pendant or a little trinket :).

#### Circuit:

Astable multivibrator circuit with a low-pass filter into a transistor driving 2 LED's

#### Quirks:

The circuit can take up to 10 seconds before it starts blinking. Maybe could be fixed?

### Level crossing (přejezd)

#### Description:

A czech AŽD-97 crossing sign. Has 2 operational modes, that can be changed with 2 solder bridges on the back. It can also be soldered with SMD or THT parts. 

**Modes:**

1. The LEDs blink
2. The LEDs are normally off. Pad in the middle can be used as a button to turn the LEDs on
